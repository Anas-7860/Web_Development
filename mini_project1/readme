## basic flow of the project

initialize the project with - npm init -y

install expressjs - npm i express

we did set the entry point of the project at 'index.js' so make a file with same name

store express modeule in a const so as to use that in the future and also store express() func in a constant 'app' to use all the functionalities of express through app.

set up parsers for encoding and decoding

setup routes

set the port on which the the browser is going to show the frontend

##  setting up frontend through backend using [ejs]

install module ejs - npm i ejs

then configure the express to use ejs to use views directory as the tempelate engine for the frontend work - app.set('view engine','ejs'); im index.js

make a directory views - the name should be correct

then make any ejs file in it 

after this we can use render instead of send in - res.send('something'); as res.render('something(this is a ejs file we doesnt have to write naming extensions)');

## setting up public static file - eg: images and css

now we are importing path module to join the path of the current directory to the publuc directory

and we are telling that if there is a request of a static file like images or videos or css then see through public directory - app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname,'public')));
